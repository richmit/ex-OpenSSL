While the OpenSSL library is most commonly used for SSL, I find that
my most frequent, direct use of the library has nothing to do with
SSL. Some of these non-SSL aspects of the OpenSSL library are
illustrated below.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/openssl.html).

Have fun!
